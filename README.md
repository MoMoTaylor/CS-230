Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The Gaming Room was the client and they currently have a game for Android called Draw It or Lost It. The client requested compatibility with more platforms and an improvement in software functionality. I paid particular attention to making all of my documentation clear and concise.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found that working through the design document assisted on finding what elements should be prioritized and focused on in development.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The recommendations section is what I would revise. I would do more research so I could provide better recommendations for the client.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I first took into consideration of the user's needs by emphasizing a focus on increasing functionality. Even though the client heavily requested expansion on to other platforms, if the functionality of the program was still poor then that would hurt the user's experience in the long run. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the ones who keep the demand for the end product. 


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software by providing consise codes and clear comments so that in the future it can easily be maintained and updated.
